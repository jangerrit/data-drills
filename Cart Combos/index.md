# Objective

Your dataset contains one year of point-of-sale transactions from a grocery store, including approximately 88,000 line items across 20,000 customer orders.

Your task is to identify the five product pairs that are purchased together most often.

- Two products are "purchased together" if they appear in the same transaction
- A pair must consist of two different products
- Product pairs are unordered, meaning (A, B) and (B, A) should be treated as the same pair
- Count each pair once per transaction, regardless of the quantity purchased

# Control question

How many transactions does the top product pairing have?

# Correct answer
5358
